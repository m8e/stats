## FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the benefit of the points?

We could never possibly thank properly enough for contributions from members in
this group. This group is all about open source spirit and helping others. These
points will help you check your contribution activity in our group compared to
other members and bring some fun in PHP back. Leetness in the universe is also
not excluded for getting higher score than other members :)

### How are points calculated?

* Each post, each comment and each reply to a comment in the group gets you one point.
* Number of likes of your topic, comment or reply gets you extra points.
* More detailed comments and replies get you extra points.
* Sequential comments and replies on topic from same members are merged and calculated as one.
* Topics, comments and replies with recommended links get you extra points.
* Topics with only image and lacky description or question aren't rewarded with
  points.
* Topics with disabled comments aren't rewarded with points. Comments are in
  most cases turned off by administrators for various reasons, such as not
  following the group's code of conduct or low quality.
* Offensive messages and inappropriate links can get you negative points.
* Some topics (such as administrators announcements and similar) are awarded with
  extra points as a recognition for special contributions to the group.
* Messages with source code don't get points. Using no-paste services such as gist,
  pastebin and similar is recommended.

### What is the default points configuration and why such configuration?

Configuration for calculating the points aims to encourages the group code of
conduct and recommended netiquette for online communication in internet communities
such as this. All the configuration parameters are described in details in the
[points.yaml](/config/points.yaml) and
[offensive_words.yaml](/config/offensive_words.yaml) files and have been
carefully set for this group.

### Why some sites get negative points?

Answering other people's questions is a very important part of being a member in
development community. Group aims for quality discussions and not every answer
and resource is always the best for the given situation. To promote the best
possible answers, some links are not recommended and get you negative points.
Every developer should know how to use search engines but question was probably
asked for a reason. More experienced users might suggest better resource than
those listed on the first pages of the search engines.
